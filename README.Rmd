# Understanding, evaluating, and improving forecasts of infectious disease burden,

This repository contains the material to create the course page.

All the raw material is in the folder `sessions/` and is written in
`quarto`. Any changes to the quarto files are automatically
updated on the web site once committed to the `main` branch.

To add a lesson, add a `.qmd` file in the `sessions` folder with a YAML field `order:` corresponding to where it fits in, and edit `sessions.qmd` to add it to the schedule.

## Local testing

The `html` pages can be generated locally using the function

```{r render, eval = FALSE}
quarto::quarto_render()
```
