[Introduction to the course and the instructors](slides/introduction-to-the-course-and-the-instructors)

### Aim of the course

In this course we will explore how to:

-   Visualize and interpret infectious disease forecasts
-   Evaluate forecast performance and limitations
-   Combine multiple forecasts into ensembles

Predictive modeling has become crucial for public health decision-making and pandemic preparedness. 
Through this workshop, we aim to make forecast interpretation and evaluation more accessible to academics and public health institutions.

### Approach

Each session in the course:

- builds on the previous one so that participants will have an overview of forecast evaluation by the end of the course;
- starts with a short introductory talk;
- mainly consists of interactive content that participants will work through;
- has optional/additional material that can be skipped or completed after the course ends;

For those attending the in-person version the course also:

- has multiple instructors ready to answer questions about this content; if several people have a similar question we may pause the session and discuss it with the group;
- ends with a wrap-up and discussion where we review the sessions material.

### Timeline for the course

The course consists of four main sessions spread across an afternoon.
